User: Whats a good Yorick Top lane starter item for season 14\AI: For season 14, when playing Yorick in the top lane, a good starter item to consider is "Doran's Shield". This item provides a solid foundation for Yorick, who can be susceptible to poke and trades early in the game. Doran's Shield helps mitigate some of this incoming damage and keeps him healthier in lane, allowing him to farm up and reach his power spikes.

Here's why Doran's Shield is a good choice:

1. **Health Regeneration:** It offers health regeneration, which is crucial for surviving the early laning phase, especially against ranged opponents or champions with strong early poke.

2. **Damage Block:** The passive damage block from enemy champion basic attacks helps Yorick to sustain through trades
